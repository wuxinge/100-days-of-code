# Day 1 - Working with Variables in Python to Manage Data
## Learning Takeaways 
### Functions/Concepts
1. **Print():** print a string into the console
2. **Input():** allows users to input data
3. **Len()**: determine the length of the string
4. **Variables:** containers for storing data values
### Syntax 
1. Create new lines: ```\n```
2. Space: ````" " ````
3. String concatenation: ```+```
can't concatenate a string to an integer
4. Comment: ```#```
  <br>shortcut: cmd+/ (Mac) | ctrl +/ (wins)
5. Swap values between 2 variables: ```a,b = b,a ```
   <br> method 2: use a temp variable to store value (see day-1-4-exercise)
  
6. Single or Double Quotes? (insert a quote inside a string)
   <br>Error: ```print("I said "Wow!" to him")```
   <br> Reason: Python sees "WOW!" as code rather than a string.
   <br>Correct: ```print('I said "Wow!" to him')```
