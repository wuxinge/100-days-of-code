## Learning Takeaways/Concepts 
* append() vs extend()
  * extend(): extend the list by appending elements from the iterable
    ```
    new_card = [deal_card()] # new_card must be a list itself
    user_card.edtend(new_card)
    
    ```
  * append(): appends an element to the end of the list
    ```
    new_card = deal_card()
    user_card.append(new_card) #only want to add a single item/not a list to an existing list 
    ```
